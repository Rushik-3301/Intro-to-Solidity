# Intro-to-Solidity...
* Solidity is a high-level programming language designed for implementing smart contracts. It is statically-typed object-oriented language. Solidity is highly influenced by Python, c++, and JavaScript which runs on the Ethereum Virtual Machine(EVM).Solidity is the most used and stable Blockchain Programming language recommended by developers worldwide.Solidity is a programming language for writing smart contracts. Learn how to build your first smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain...
* Solidity is primary language for blockchains running platforms.
* Solidity can be used to creating contracts like voting, blind auctions, crowdfunding, multi-signature wallets, etc.

# WHAT IS SOLIDITY USED FOR ?
* Solidity is an object-oriented programming language created specifically by the Ethereum Network team for constructing and designing smart contracts on Blockchain platforms. It's used to create smart contracts that implement business logic and generate a chain of transaction records in the blockchain system...

# Solidity advantages
* Benefits of Solidity Programming Language is :-
1) A simple, easy-to-use programming language to write smart contracts for dApps.
2) An open-source, object-oriented high-level programming language.
3) It provides an Application Binary Interface (ABI) to avoid syntax errors.

# Solidity â€“ Types
* Solidity is a statically typed language, which implies that the type of each of the variables should be specified. Data types allow the compiler to check the correct usage of the variables. The declared types have some default values called Zero-State, for example for bool the default value is False. Likewise other statically typed languages Solidity has Value types and Reference types which are defined below:

# Value Types
* Value type variables store their own data. These are the basic data types provided by solidity. These types of variables are always passed by value. The variables are copied wherever they are used in function arguments or assignment. Value type data types in solidity are listed below: 
1) Boolean: This data type accepts only two values True or False.
2) Integer: This data type is used to store integer values, int and uint are used to declare signed and unsigned integers respectively.
3) Fixed Point Numbers: These data types are not fully supported in solidity yet, as per the Solidity documentation. They can be declared as fixed and unfixed for signed and unsigned fixed-point numbers of varying sizes respectively.
4) Address: Address hold a 20-byte value which represents the size of an  Ethereum address. An address can be used to get balance or to transfer a balance by balance and transfer method respectively.
5) Bytes and Strings: Bytes are used to store a fixed-sized character set while the string is used to store the character set equal to or more than a byte. The length of bytes is from 1 to 32, while the string has a dynamic length. Byte has an advantage that it uses less gas, so better to use when we know the length of data.
